# using pyinstaller - downside is it's slow to start up
pyinstaller --clean frontend_main.spec

# or run the nuitka python file
# cd into the frontend_main.dist
# make the file executable
chmod +x frontend_main.bin  
# then run the binary 
 ./frontend_main.bin


# game speed seems similar, but nuitka loads *way* faster
