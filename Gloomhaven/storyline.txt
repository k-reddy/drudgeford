game theme:
- Things are going wrong in your village and your friends swear it wasnâ€™t their doing. You need to go in search of the one who is pulling the strings
- you go to first dungeon, and when you win, the "orchestrator" (boss) shows up and throws you into a different dimension
- keeps happening until you catch up with them and do boss fight
- you follow the cycle of life and death leading you to the final womb room 
- it has puppets and the orchestrator themselves 
- order of dungeons: forest, inferno, icy tundra, Graveyard, womb, orchestrator boss fight
