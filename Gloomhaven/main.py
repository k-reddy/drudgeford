- You and the monster will attack each other once per turn in a random order
- You can only attack if you are within range of your enemy
- You pick your attacks, and the monster's are randomly generated
- Each attack has a movement associated with it. If you're not in range, you'll move that amount toward your enemy
- If you end in range, you will attack. If not, you won't attack this turn.
- Whoever runs out of health first loses

Good luck!'''
