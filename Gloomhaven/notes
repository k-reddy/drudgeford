To pick up on:
- figure out how to deal with the id issue
        - right now i have the board holding everythign (health etc.), which is maybe ideal
          for not cheating if this were on a server
        - but the complication is that things like monster.health don't work now, so then you have
          to figure out who the monster is and then ask for their health
        - before, i had the players holding everything but location, but then you have issues
          where you're messily trying to say hey attack the player with this id
          then you have to somehow figure out who that player is, because i just have a map of
          id to location
        - one possible solution is to pass around the objects themselves (so the player asks for their
          opponents then picks one to attack
          but this seems messy also

- implement everything specified
- install ruff or black
- make action_card a dataclass
- make direction an enum
- see John's code comments
